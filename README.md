# Program-Design-COP3514
Took this course in Spring 2017 at the University of South Florida under Professor Wang.
These are the weekly projects. Note that not all weeks had projects. 

Week 1 Project List:
  replace: Prompts the User to enter a three-digit integer and then replace each digit by the sum of that digit plus 6 modulus 10. If the integer entered is less than 100or greater than 999, the program outputa an error message and aborts the program.
  convert: Gives the User a choice menu to convert between different systems between metric and imperial. 

Week 2 Project List:
  remove: Takes a message from the Uesr, removes all punctuation, then returns the message all uppercase. 
  voltage: Calculates the voltage for an experiment based on time. 
  
Week 4 Project List:
  complex: Adds, subtracts, and multiplies complex numbers. 
  cents: Takes an amount of cents, and determines how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies it would take to make that amount. 
  
Week 5 Project List:
  replace2: Prompts the User to enter a three-digit integer and then replace each digit by the sum of that digit plus 6 modulus 10. If the integer entered is less than 100or greater than 999, the program outputa an error message and aborts the program. Then swaps the first and last digit of the integer.
  barcode2: Displays a barcode in binary.
